This is a Godot project about simulating a virtual ecosystem. 
Currently it is in its early stages and only has basic terrain generation and a water shader.

Ideally, in the future there would also be plants and animals (walking, flying and swimming animals) 
which the player can spawn on the map and which would then try to survive and reproduce.
